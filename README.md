# CustomNN

**CustomNN** is a lightweight, simple neural network library developed for personal use and to deepen my understanding of the mechanics behind backpropagation.

## Features

- **Multiple Layer Types**:
  - Convolutional
  - Sigmoid 
  - ReLU
  - Fully Connected (Standard)
  - Softmax (primarily for output layers but flexible for general use)
  
- **Flexible Architecture**:  
  A modular layer-based architecture for constructing custom neural networks.

- **Matrix Math Library**:  
  A built-from-scratch matrix mathematics library to handle the core computations.

- **MNIST Data Handling**:  
  Includes functionality to convert MNIST data (from CSV format) into the libraryâ€™s matrix implementation.

## Future Plans

- **CUDA Integration**:  
  Extend the matrix library to leverage the CUDA API for faster computation.
